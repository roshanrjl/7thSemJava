Java and the Db is the completely other thing there is no any similarities between them.
Java is a programming language and Db is a database. Java is used to create applications, while Db is used to store and manage data. Java can be used to interact with databases using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), which allows Java applications to connect to and manipulate databases.

while JDBC is a Java API that allows Java applications to interact with databases, it is not a database itself. JDBC provides a standard interface for connecting to databases, executing SQL queries, and retrieving results. It is used to bridge the gap between Java applications and various database management systems (DBMS) such as MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and others.

# JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) all the steps from start to end
1. **Import JDBC Packages**: Import the necessary JDBC packages in your Java program.
   ```java
   import java.sql.*;
   ```
2. **Load the JDBC Driver**: Load the JDBC driver for your specific database. This step is optional in newer versions of JDBC, as the driver can be automatically loaded.
   ```java
    Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
    ```
3. **Establish a Connection**: Use the `DriverManager` class to establish a connection to the database using the connection URL, username, and password.
    ```java
    String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydatabase";
    String username = "root";
    String password = "password";
    Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
    ```
4. **Create a Statement**: Create a `Statement` or `PreparedStatement` object to execute SQL queries.
    ```java
    Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
    ```
5. **Execute SQL Queries**: Use the `Statement` or `PreparedStatement` object to execute SQL queries (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
    ```java
    String sql = "SELECT * FROM users";
    ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(sql);
    ```

6. **Process the Result Set**: Process the results returned by the query using the `ResultSet` object.
    ```java
    while (resultSet.next()) {
        int id = resultSet.getInt("id");
        String name = resultSet.getString("name");
        System.out.println("ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name);
    }
    ```
7. **Close the Resources**: Close the `ResultSet`, `Statement`, and `Connection` objects to free up resources.
    ```java
    resultSet.close();
    statement.close();
    connection.close();
    ```
8. **Handle Exceptions**: Use try-catch blocks to handle SQL exceptions that may occur during the database operations.
    ```java
    try {
        // Database operations
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
    ```
9. **Use Transactions (Optional)**: If you need to perform multiple operations as a single unit of work, you can use transactions. Enable auto-commit mode and manage transactions using `commit()` and `rollback()`.
    ```java
    connection.setAutoCommit(false);
    // Perform multiple operations
    connection.commit(); // Commit the transaction
    // or
    connection.rollback(); // Rollback the transaction in case of an error
    ```
10. **Use Connection Pooling (Optional)**: For better performance, consider using connection pooling libraries like HikariCP or Apache DBCP to manage database connections efficiently.
    ```java
